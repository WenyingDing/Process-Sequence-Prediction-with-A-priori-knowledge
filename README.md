# ProcessSequencePrediction

The project deals with predictions of the business process outcomes.

These include the suffix of the running trace, time to completion.

To accomplish this task RNN with LSTM cells are used.

The code is written Python, using Keras, and any of Tensorflow or Theano libraries as backend.
Certain parts of the prediction algorithm use Java implementation.
